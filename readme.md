*They/them* 

I crave delicious design and have a fetish for minimalism. GUIs have their place, but I'll take a command line anyday. Throughout my life, I've evangelized technology through social media, blogging, podcasting and just about any other creative medium you can think of. I have coded, hacked, tweaked and patched my way through WordPress, Ghost, PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, Sass, Git, Linux, Mac OS and Windows. 

I'm great at breaking things, and even better at fixing them. In previous lives, I've been a co-founder of the IndyGeek tech news site and a former Comcaster working on customer experience and social media strategy. Now, I work on photography full-time and some tech projects in my spare time.
